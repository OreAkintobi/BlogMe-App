### What this is.

This is a barebones Blog App built with React Native, Expo CLI, Axios and a small JSON server I created [here](https://github.com/OreAkintobi/ReactNativeLearning3-JSON-Server "here").

### How to Use

- First of all, please clone and start the JSON server repository for this app [here](https://github.com/OreAkintobi/ReactNativeLearning3-JSON-Server "here").
- Clone this repo and open in command line.
- Make sure you have the JSON server running and the correct link from ngrok is placed in the jsonServer file of this project.
- Run `yarn install` in the project folder to install all the required dependencies.
- Run `yarn start` to open the expo project window in your browser and run the app on your emulator or mobile device
